Modular Approach

TTS service (TtsService), animations (ScanAnimation), and screens (VerifiedScreen) are well-separated, making the code more readable and maintainable.


Efficient Camera Handling
Permissions are correctly requested, the front camera is initialized, and errors are handled with retries.
Frames are skipped (frameInterval = 3) to optimize processing.
Proper disposal of the camera and other resources is ensured.


Smooth User Experience
Step-based UI (_buildStepIndicator, _buildStepLine) keeps users informed about their progress.
TTS feedback (_ttsService.speak(getInstruction())) enhances usability.


Liveliness Detection is Well-Handled
Blink detection, smile detection, and head movements (left/right) are correctly implemented.
The verification countdown and retry mechanism ensure robustness.
